# Excel_CostumerComplaints_analysis
Project for FinServ Solutions.

## Project Objective

This project was developed for **FinServ Solutions** as an assignment within the Data Analytics Master by ProfessionAI. FinServ solutions is a company specializing in software solutions for managing customer complaints in the financial sector.  
The main goal is to enhance the effectiveness of customer complaint analysis by restructuring and customizing a spreadsheet. This will improve information access and better support decision-making processes.

## üí° Motivation

FinServ identified several inefficiencies in the current spreadsheet used for complaint management. The main issues included:

- Difficulty in reading and interpreting the data
- Limited ability to extract meaningful insights
- Ineffective geographical analysis

A targeted reorganization of the spreadsheet will improve:

- Visibility of key information
- Speed in identifying issues
- Operational agility for the customer service team

## üåü Expected Added Value

- **Improved Geographical Analysis**:  
  A new dedicated tab enables the identification of areas with the highest number of complaints, supporting more targeted actions.

- **Enhanced Decision-Making**:  
  A statistical insights tab and data filtering features make it easier to identify the most frequent issues quickly and effectively.

- **Faster Response Times**:  
  The new structure highlights resolution times, improving performance monitoring and accountability.
